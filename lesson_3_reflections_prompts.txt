1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are:
        i.)   Collaborating, so others can make changes to the repository
        ii.)  Working directly from GitHub
        iii.) Working from various computers at different times.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatically keeping up date may mean that your commits are not per 
    single logical change but rather to do with internet connections, etc. 
    This is very bad for building something. It will just at confusion. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is just a label for a commit.
    A clone is a copy of a repository on github.
    A fork is a clone made on github which allows use of another peson's
    repository, while still giving them credit, and not changing their repo. 
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
